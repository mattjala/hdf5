 * struct lfht_node_t
 *
 * Node in the lock free singly linked list that is used to store entries in the 
 * lock free hash table.  The fields of the node are discussed individually below:
 *
 * tag:		Unsigned integer set to LFHT_VALID_NODE whenever the node is either
 *              in the SLL or the free list, and to LFHT_INVALID_NODE just before 
 *              it is discarded.
 *
 * next:        Atomic pointer to the next entry in the SLL, or NULL if there is 
 *              no next entry.  Note that due to the alignment guarantees of 
 *              malloc() & calloc(), the least significant few bits (at least three
 *              in all cases investigated to date) will be zero.  
 *
 *              This fact is used to allow atomic marking of the node for deletion.
 *              If the low order bit of the next pointer is 1, the node is logically
 *              deleted from the SLL.  It will be physically deleted from the SLL
 *              by a subsequent insert or delete call.  See section 9.8 of 
 *              "The Art of Multiprocessor Programming" by Herlihy, Luchangco, 
 *              Shavit, and Spear for further details.
 *
 * id:          ID associated with the contents of the node.  This field is 
 *              logically undefined if the node is a sentinel node
 *
 * hash:        For regular node, this is the hash value computed from the id.
 *              For sentinel nodes, this is the smallest value that can map to 
 *              the associated hash table bucket -- see section 13.3.3 of 
 *              "The Art of Multiprocessor Programming" by Herlihy, Luchangco,
 *              Shavit, and Spear for further details.
 *
 *              Note that duplicate hash codes cannot appear in the LFSLL, and that 
 *              nodes in the LFSLL appear in strictly increasing hash order.
 *
 * sentinel:    Boolean flag that is true if the node is a sentinel node, and 
 *              false otherwise.
 *
 * value:       Pointer to whatever structure is used to contain the value associated
 *              with the id, or NULL if the node is a sentinel node.
 *
 *              This field is atomic, as we allow the client code to modify it in
 *              an existing entry in the hash table.

/*********************************************************************************** 
 * struct lfht_t 
 * 
 * Root of a lock free hash table (LFHT). 
 * 
 * Entries in the hash table are stored in a lock free singly linked list (LFSLL). 
 * 
 * Each hash bucket has a sentinel node in the linked list that marks the 
 * beginning of the bucket.  Pointers to the sentinel nodes are stored in 
 * the index. 
 * 
 * Section 13.3.3 of "The Art of Multiprocessor Programming" by Herlihy, 
 * Luchangco, Shavit, and Spear describes most of the details of the algorithm. 
 * However, that discussion presumes implementation in a language with 
 * garbage collection -- which simplifies matters greatly. 
 * 
 * The basic problem here is that we can't free a node that has been 
 * removed from the LFSLL until we know that all references to it have been 
 * discarded.  This is a problem, as an arbitrary number of threads may 
 * have a pointer to a node at the point at which it is physically deleted 
 * from the LFSLL. 
 * 
 * We solve this problem as follows: 
 * 
 * First, don't allow any node on the LFSLL to become visible outside of 
 * the LFHT package.  As a result, we know that all pointers to a discarded 
 * node have been discarded as well once all threads that were active in the 
 * LFHT code at the point that the node was discarded have exited the LFHT 
 * code.  We know this, as any such pointers must have been allocated on the 
 * stack, and were therefore discarded when the associated threads left the 
 * LFHT package. 
 * 
 * Second, maintain a free list of discarded nodes, and decorate each discarded 
 * node with a reference count (see declarations of lfht_node_t and lfht_fl_node_t 
 * above).  
 *
 * Ideally, on entry to the LFHT package, each thread would increment the
 * reference count on the last node on the free list, and then decrement it
 * on exit. However, until I can find a way to make this operation atomic, this
 * is not workable, as the tail node may advance to the head of the free list
 * and be re-allocated in the time between the read of the pointer to the last
 * element on the free list, and the increment of the indicated ref_count.
 *
 * Instead, on entry to the LFHT package, each thread allocates a node, sets its
 * ref_count to 1, and releases it to the free list.  On exit, it decrements
 * the nodeâ€™s ref_count back to zero.  This has the same net effect, but is not as
 * efficient.  Needless to say, this issue should be revisited for the production
 * version.   
 * 
 * If we further require that nodes on the free list are only removed from 
 * the head of the list (either for re-use or discard), and then only when their 
 * reference counts are zero, we have that nodes are only released to the 
 * heap or re-used if all threads that were active in LFHT package at the point 
 * at which the node was place on the free list have since exited the LFHT 
 * package. 
 * 
 * Between them, these two adaptions solve the problem of avoiding accesses to 
 * nodes that have been returned to the heap. 
 * 
 * Finally, observe that the LFSLL code is simplified if it always contains two 
 * sentinel nodes with (effectively) values negative and positive infinity -- 
 * thus avoiding operations that touch the ends of the list.
 * 
 * In this context, the index sentinel node with hash value zero is created 
 * at initialization time and serves as the node with value negative infinity. 
 * However, since a sentinel node with hash positive infinity is not created 
 * by the index, we add a sentinel node with hash LLONG_MAX at initialization 
 * to serve this purpose. 
 * 
 * Note that the LFSLL used in the implementation of the LFHT is a modified 
 * version of the lock free singly linked list discussed in chapter 9 of 
 * "The Art of Multiprocessor Programming" by Herlihy, Luchangco, Shavit, 
 * and Spear. 
 * 
 * The fields of lfht_t are discussed individually below. 
 * 
 * 
 * tag:         Unsigned integer set to LFHT_VALID when the instance of lfht_t 
 *              is initialized, and to LFHT_INVALID just before the memory for 
 *              the instance of struct lfHT_t is discarded. 
 * 
 * 
 * Lock Free Singly Linked List related fields: 
 * 
 * lfsll_root:  Atomic Pointer to the head of the SLL.  Other than during setup, 
 *              this field will always point to the first sentinal node in the 
 *              index, whose hash will be zero. 
 * 
 * lfsll_log_len:  Atomic integer used to maintain a count of the number of nodes 
 *              in the SLL less the sentry nodes and the regular nodes that 
 *              have been marked for deletion. 
 * 
 *              Note that due to the delay between the insertion or deletion 
 *              of a node, and the update of the field, this count may be off 
 *              for brief periods of time. 
 * 
 * lfsll_phys_len:  Atomic integer used to maintain a count of the actual number 
 *              of nodes in the SLL.  This includes the sentry nodes, and any 
 *              nodes that have been marked for deletion, but that have not 
 *              been physically deleted. 
 * 
 *              Note that due to the delay between the insertion or deletion 
 *              of a node, and the update of the field, this count may be off 
 *              for brief periods of time. 
 * 
 * 
 * Free list related fields: 
 *
 * 
 * fl_shead:    Atomic instance of struct lfht_flsptr_t, which contains a 
 *              pointer (ptr) to the head of the free list for the lock free 
 *              singly linked list, and a serial number (sn) which must be 
 *              incremented each time a new value is assigned to fl_shead. 
 * 
 *              The objective here is to prevent ABA bugs, which would 
 *              otherwise occasionally allow allocation of free list 
 *              nodes with positive ref counts. 
 * 
 * fl_stail:    Atomic instance of struct lfht_flsptr_t, which contains a 
 *              pointer (ptr) to the tail of the free list for the lock free 
 *              singly linked list, and a serial number (sn) which must be 
 *              incremented each time a new value is assigned to fl_stail. 
 * 
 *              The objective here is to prevent ABA bugs, which would 
 *              otherwise occasionally allow the tail of the free list to 
 *              get ahead of the head -- resulting in the increment of the 
 *              ref count on nodes that are no longer in the free list. 
 * 
 * fl_len:      Atomic integer used to maintain a count of the number of nodes 
 *              on the free list.  Note that due to the delay between free list 
 *              insertions and deletions, and the update of this field, this 
 *              count may be off for brief periods of time. 
 * 
 *              Further, the free list must always contain at least one entry.
 *              Thus, when correct, fl_len will be one greater than the number 
 *              of nodes available on the free list. 
 * 
 * max_desired_fl_len: Integer field containing the desired maximum free list 
 *              length.  This is of necessity a soft limit as entries cannot 
 *              be removed from the head of the free list unless their 
 *              reference counts are zero.  Further, at most one entry is 
 *              removed from the head of the free list per call to 
 *              lfht_discard_node(). 
 * 
 * next_sn:     Serial number to be assigned to the next node placed on the 
 *              free list. 
 * 
 *
 * Hash Bucket Index: 
 * 
 * index_bits:  Number of index bits currently in use. 
 * 
 * max_index_bits:  Maximum value that index_bits is allowed to attain.  If 
 *              this field is set to zero, the lock free hash table becomes 
 *              a lock free singly linked list, as only one hash bucket is 
 *              permitted. 
 * 
 * index_masks: Array of unsigned long long containing the bit masks used to 
 *              compute the index into the hash bucket array from a hash code. 
 * 
 * buckets_defined: Convenience field.  This is simply 2 ** index_bits. 
 *              Needless to say, buckets_initialized must always be less than 
 *              or equal to buckets_initialized. 
 * 
 * buckets_initialized: Number of hash buckets that have been initialized -- 
 *              that is, their sentinel nodes have been created, and inserted 
 *              into the LFSLL, and a pointer to the sentinel node has been 
 *              copied into the bucket_idx. 
 * 
 * bucket_idx:  Array of pointers to lfht_node_t.  Each entry in the array is 
 *              either NULL, or contains a pointer to the sentinel node marking 
 *              the beginning of the hash bucket indicated by its index in the 
 *              array. 
 * 
 * Statistics Fields:
 *
 * The following fields are used to record statistics on the operation of the 
 * SLL for purposes of debugging and optimization.  All fields are atomic.
 *
 * max_lfsll_log_len: Maximum logical length of the LFSLL.  In the multi-thread 
 *              case, this number should be viewed as aproximate.
 *
 * max_lfsll_phys_len: Maximum physical length of the LFSLL.  In the multi-thread 
 *              case, this number should be viewed as aproximate.
 *
 *
 * max_fl_len:  Maximum number of nodes that have resided on the free list
 *              at any point during the current run.  In the multi-thread
 *              case, this number should be viewed as aproximate.
 *
 * num_nodes_allocated: Number of nodes allocated from the heap.
 * 
 * num_nodes_freed: Number of nodes freed.
 *
 * num_node_free_candidate_selection_restarts: Number of times the attempt
 *              to pull a node from the head of the free list and free 
 *              had to be restared due to a change in fl_head.
 *
 * num_nodes_added_to_fl: Number of nodes added to the free list.
 *
 * num_nodes_drawn_from_fl: Number of nodes drawn from the free list for 
 *              re-use.
 *
 * num_fl_head_update_cols: Number of collisions when updating the fl_head
 *              for a node withdrawal.
 *
 * num_fl_tail_update_cols: Number of collisions when updating the fl_tail
 *              for an additions.
 *
 * num_fl_append_cols: Number of collisions when appending a newly freed
 *              node to the end of the free list.
 *
 * num_fl_req_denied_due_to_empty: Number of free list requests denied 
 *              because the free list was (logically) empty. (recall that
 *              the free list must always have at least one entry.).
 *
 * num_fl_req_denied_due_to_ref_count: Number of free list requests 
 *              denied because the entry at the head of the free list 
 *              had a positive ref count.
 *
 * num_fl_node_ref_cnt_incs: Number of time the ref count on some node 
 *              on the free list has been incremented.
 *
 * num_fl_node_ref_cnt_inc_retrys: Number of times a ref count increment
 *              on some node on the free list had to me un-done due to 
 *              a change in fl_tail.
 *
 * num_fl_node_ref_cnt_decs: Number of times the ref count on some 
 *              node on the free list has been decremented.
 *
 * num_fl_frees_skiped_due_to_empty:  Number of times that 
 *              lfsll_discard_node() has attempted to find a node to 
 *              free, but been unable to do so because the free list 
 *              is empty.  Assuming a reasonable max_desired_fl_len,
 *              this is very improbable -- however, since we must
 *              check for the possibility, we may as well make note 
 *              of it if it occurs.
 *
 * num_fl_frees_skiped_due_to_ref_count: Number of times that
 *              lfsll_discard_node() has attempted to find a node to
 *              free, but been unable to do so because the first item
 *              on the free list has a positive ref count.  Absent 
 *              either a very small max_desired_fl_len or a very large
 *              number of threads, this is also improbable -- but again,

 *              waiting for the sinner to complete the job.
 *
 * insertions:  Number of entries that have been inserted into the SLL.
 *
 * insertion_failure: Number of times an insertion attempt has failed.
 *
 * ins_restarts_due_to_ins_col: Number of times an insertion has had to restart
